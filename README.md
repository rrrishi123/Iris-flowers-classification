# Iris-flowers-classification
This project focuses on classifying the three species of Iris flowers (i,e. Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor, Iris-Virginica) on the basis of lengths and width of sepals and petals.
# dataset (Iris.csv)
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes three Iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.
The columns in this dataset are:
-Id:Id given to the dataset
-SepalLengthCm:Length of sepal (in cm)
-SepalWidthCm: Width of sepal (in cm)
-PetalLengthCm:Length of petal (in cm)
-PetalWidthCm: Width of petal (in cm)
-Species: Specie's Name
